# binee (Binary Emulation Environment)

Binee is a complete binary emulation environment that focuses on introspection
of all IO operations. Primary goals for this project are to provide a flexible
environment for determining a binaries side effects on the system.

The goals Binee tries to solve are the following:

1. Realistic loading of a PE file and its required dependencies. The userland
   memory should look as close to a real execution as possible.
2. Easy to use hooking framework. We want to create a flexible hooking
   framework that allows the analyst to rapidly implement new hooks and capture
   data.
3. Mock out as much of the OS internals as reasonably possible. Currently,
   there are small mocks of the file system, registry, threading and TIB/PEB
   structures for Windows.
4. The OS environment, as much as possible, should be defined in a
   configuration file. This enables rapid movement from environment to
   environment.

**If you choose to use Binee to emulate portions of Microsoft Windows, you are
solely responsible for obtaining any necessary rights and licenses from
Microsoft.**

# Setup and developing in Docker container

If you are running Binee on Microsoft Windows, you can skip the mock file system step. 

Most malware will require at least some standard DLLs and these DLLs will need
to be accessible from the mock file system. The default "root" mock file system
is located in `os/win10_32/`. In order to allow for the malware to load up DLLs
you will need to copy them into the appropriate location within the mock file
system. Typically, these should be copied into,
`os/win10_32/windows/system32/`. Once you have the required files in that
directory, you can move onto the compiling and running step.

## Compiling and running

Build with the following docker command `docker build -t binee .`

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/bineedev/go/src/binee binee bash
```

Download Golang dependencies and build Binee

```
root@2b0fee41629f:~/go/src/binee# go get
root@2b0fee41629f:~/go/src/binee# go build
```

At this point you should be able to execute binee within the Docker container
and see the usage menu.

```
root@2b0fee41629f:~/go/src/binee# ./binee -v
usage ./binee [-aAhvveis] [FILE] [ARGS]
  -a <apiset dll name>     Returns the real dll name given an apiset dll
  -A                       List all apisets and their mappings
  -c FILE                  Path to a configuration file
  -e FILE                  List file exports
  -h                       Show this usage menu
  -i FILE                  List file imports
  -j                       Output as JSON
  -v[v]                    Verbosity level, two v's for more verbose
```

If you are running on Microsoft Windows and/or you have your mock file system
configured properly, you should be able to execute all the PE files within the
`tests/` directory.
